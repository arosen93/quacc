# DFT Package Setup

Here, we outline how to ensure that QuAcc can run the quantum chemistry package of your choosing. You only need to follow the instructions for the code(s) you intend to use.

## VASP

1. Define the `VASP_PP_PATH` environment variable that points to your pseudopotential library. See the [ASE documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/vasp.html#pseudopotentials) for full details. We recommend including this in your `~/.bashrc` file.
2. Define the `ASE_VASP_VDW` environment variable to point to the `vdw_kernel.bindat` file distributed with VASP. Again, refer to the [ASE documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/vasp.html#pseudopotentials) for additional details. We recommend including this in your `~/.bashrc` file.
3. To run VASP with Custodian (the default behavior in QuAcc), you will need to define a `VASP_PARALLEL_CMD` environment variable that tells Custodian how to parallelize VASP. For instance, this might look something like `export VASP_PARALLEL_CMD="srun -N 2 --ntasks-per-node 24"`. Note, the VASP executables are not included in this environment variable. For convenience, we recommend specifying this environment variable at runtime so you can easily modify it.
4. By default, Custodian will assume that the VASP executables can be run with `vasp_std` or `vasp_gam` for standard or gamma-point calculations. If you need to use different executable names or wish to change any Custodian settings from the selected defaults, create and modify the `vasp_custodian_settings.yaml` file found [here](https://github.com/arosen93/quacc/blob/main/quacc/defaults/custodian_settings/vasp_custodian_settings.yaml) and set the path to this file in a `QUACC_VASP_CUSTODIAN_YAML_PATH` environment variable.

## Gaussian

By default, QuAcc (via ASE) will look for executables named `g16`, `g09`, or `g03` (in order of decreasing preference). If you want to use a different executable name, define the `ASE_GAUSSIAN_COMMAND` environment variable accordingly. See the [ASE documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/gaussian.html) for more details.

As noted in the [ASE documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/gaussian.html), by default the executables named `g16`, `g09`, or `g03` will be searched (in order of decreasing preference) to run Gaussian. To use a different executable name, you will need to define an environment variable named `ASE_GAUSSIAN_COMMAND`. It should be of the form `ASE_GAUSSIAN_COMMAND="/path/to/my/gaussian_executable gaussian.com > orca.log"`.

## ORCA

As noted in the [ASE documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/orca.html), to use ORCA in parallel mode, you will need to define an environment variable named `ASE_ORCA_COMMAND`. It should be of the form `ASE_ORCA_COMMAND="/path/to/my/orca orca.inp > orca.out"`.

## xTB

If you plan to use xTB with QuAcc, you will need to install the [xtb-python](https://github.com/grimme-lab/xtb-python) interface. This can be done via `conda install -c conda-force xtb-python`.

## Other Codes

For any other code, simply make sure to follow the instructions in [ASE's documentation](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/ase/ase/calculators/calculators.html#supported-calculators) for setting up your desired calculator.
